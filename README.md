# Kubernetes [k8s]

This project is all about Kubernetes, an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

## Features of Kubernetes

- **Automated rollouts and rollbacks**: Kubernetes progressively rolls out changes to your application or its configuration, while monitoring application health to ensure it doesn't kill all your instances at the same time.

- **Service discovery and load balancing**: Kubernetes can expose a container using the DNS name or using their own IP address. If traffic to a container is high, Kubernetes is able to load balance and distribute the network traffic to help the deployment stable.

- **Storage orchestration**: Kubernetes allows you to automatically mount a storage system of your choice, such as local storages, public cloud providers, and more.

- **Self-healing**: Kubernetes can restart containers that fail, replaces and reschedules containers when nodes die, kills containers that don’t respond to your user-defined health check, and doesn’t advertise them to clients until they are ready to serve.
